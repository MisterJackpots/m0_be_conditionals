# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?

I feel confident in the comparison operators and their functions, my biggest challenge so far is remember that the "==" is equal to, not the single equals sign.

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?

Feeling confident with logical operators as well.

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?

Feeling **REALLY** confident in if statements, enjoying the logic part of if/elsif/else in coding.

1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?

Besides getting stuck on using a single equals sign in my code when I should have used the double equals sign, my time spent was about what I expected.  My biggest challenge with time expectation is note taking, as I am *not* a particularly fast writer.  But that said, I think it has really helped me absorb the knowledge!


1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

I would like to tackle the other code_challenges to see if I can figure those out and improve my skillset.  I will need to bump in some time tomorrow morning to accomplish that.


1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

I do not have any specific questions on this lesson, but I look to my small group leader if anything comes up.
